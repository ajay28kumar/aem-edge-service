Words such as internationalization, telecommunications, and organizationally are expected to break across lines for smoother text alignment. However, when generating a Native PDF output with the “Use automatic hyphenation” setting enabled, you may notice that these words remain unbroken, and the text spacing becomes uneven across the paragraph. </span></div></div></div><div class="p"><div><div><span> Another paragraph to help visualize the issue: justification looks uneven, and long words like configuration, representation, and understanding continue on a single line without any hyphenation, resulting in stretched text ashgklgaps. </span></div></div></div></body></html>
